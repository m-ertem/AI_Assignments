# AI_Assignments
This repository is created in order to upload Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course assignments, in New Jersey Institute of Technology.

## Assignment-1 Neural Networks Basis
This assignment includes the work files for learning basic concepts of matrix operations, correlation coefficients and so on.

## Assignment-2 MPG Prediction
In this assignment a CSV file which contains properties of automobiles and corresponding miles-per-gallon (mpg) values, has given to us.
And we have developed a custom neural network model to predict corresponding mpg value when a curb weight or engine size is given.
We trained the model by converting the CSV file into a data frame and in the model we have used L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Assignment-3 Cat and Dog Recognition
In this assignment it has been asked to recognize cat and dog images.
In order to satisfy this, a custom neural network model is created and trained with cats and dogs images.
Relu and sigmoid activation functions are utilized.
Train and validation sets are prepared and fed to the NN model.
The results are reported with confusion matrix, precision-recall curve and ROC curve.
After that, data augmentation methods are applied to the dataset and the process is repeated.
The results are listed and the benefit of data augmentation has been observed.

## Assignment-4 UAV Identification
In this assignment youtube videos showing an UAV hovering throught the air, have been given to us.
Our aim is to identify the UAV and draw a bounding box to it at each frame, and print an identification percentage.
After the identification, by using the Kalman filter, we predicted the next position of the UAV at each frame and pointed it.

## Project ResNet-50 Based CNN
In this project, I have used CIFAR-10 dataset in order to train ResNet-50 based Convolutional Neural Network.
With 9 classes I trained the model and observed the sub-processes one-by-one. 
As given in the CNN heatmap, it can be seen that aircraft's features are highlihted successfully.
