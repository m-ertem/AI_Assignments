# AI_Assignments
This repository is created in order to upload Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course assignments, in New Jersey Institute of Technology.

## Assignment-1
This assignment includes the work files for learning basic concepts of matrix operations, correlation coefficients and so on.

## Assignment-2
In this assignment a CSV file which contains properties of automobiles and corresponding miles-per-gallon (mpg) values, has given to us.
And we have developed a custom neural network model to predict corresponding mpg value when a curb weight or engine size is given.
We trained the model by converting the CSV file into a data frame and in the model we have used L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Assignment-3
In this assignment it has been asked to recognize cat and dog images.
In order to satisfy this, a custom neural network model is created and trained with cats and dogs images.
Relu and sigmoid activation functions are utilized.
Train and validation sets are prepared and fed to the NN model.
The results are reported with confusion matrix, precision-recall curve and ROC curve.
After that, data augmentation methods are applied to the dataset and the process is repeated.
The results are listed and the benefit of data augmentation has been observed.
