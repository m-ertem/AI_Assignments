# AI_Assignments
This repository is created in order to upload Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course assignments, in New Jersey Institute of Technology.

## Assignment-1 Neural Networks Basis
This assignment includes the work files for learning basic concepts of matrix operations, correlation coefficients and so on.

## Assignment-2 MPG Prediction
In this assignment a CSV file which contains properties of automobiles and corresponding miles-per-gallon (mpg) values, has given to us.
<br/> And we have developed a custom neural network model to predict corresponding mpg value when a curb weight or engine size is given.
<br/> We trained the model by converting the CSV file into a data frame and in the model we have used L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Assignment-3 Cat and Dog Recognition
In this assignment it has been asked to recognize cat and dog images.
<br/> In order to satisfy this, a custom neural network model is created and trained with cats and dogs images.
<br/> Relu and sigmoid activation functions are utilized.
<br/> Train and validation sets are prepared and fed to the NN model.
<br/> The results are reported with confusion matrix, precision-recall curve and ROC curve.
<br/> After that, data augmentation methods are applied to the dataset and the process is repeated.
<br/> The results are listed and the benefit of data augmentation has been observed.

## Assignment-4 UAV Identification
In this assignment youtube videos showing an UAV hovering throught the air, have been given to us.
<br/> Our aim is to identify the UAV and draw a bounding box to it at each frame, and print an identification percentage.
<br/> After the identification, by using the Kalman filter, we predicted the next position of the UAV at each frame and pointed it.

## Project ResNet-50 Based CNN
In this project, I have used CIFAR-10 dataset in order to train ResNet-50 based Convolutional Neural Network.
<br/> With 9 classes I trained the model and observed the sub-processes one-by-one. 
<br/> As given in the CNN heatmap, it can be seen that aircraft's features are highlihted successfully.
